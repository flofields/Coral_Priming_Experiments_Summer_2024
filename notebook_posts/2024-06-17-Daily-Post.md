I made proper tank covers for the acclimation tank, coral colonies of Dlab 1,2,3,4 were fragmented by greg and colonies of Mdec 1,2,4 and 5 were fragmented by myself and Brett. Greg was to tired to fragment the rest of colonies and we have recieved more fragments than 36 so if a few dies we have replacments and if they can fit extras can fit in the tanks then I may decide to get phys samples for TP1. I also checked the temperture of the acclimation tank to ensure it was at 27 degrees.

06/25/2024
Set up P&R however there is only 1 functioning stir table. Started Acclimation period.

06/26/2024
I recieved the tube splitters yesterday, so today I completed the tanks, sampled the first TA sample using falcon tubes instead of the bottles because I need to acid wash them. I measured the temperature with the YSI ans the traceable thermometer and did a tris calibration. I also inserted the probes measuring the pH and temp in the basin back in the tanks.

Today i did PIcurves, due to the downpour of rain i was not able to do Mcav colonies 3 and 4. started later than usual. I started run one but due to the lack of ability to move the mouse via the mousepad i could not pause and swtich to the next light level which resulted in discarding the run, finding a mouse for the computer and choosing differet coral fraggments for run 1.
I attemped to use the Par (insert brand i brought) i bought with me but it seems it may be off. in 0 light it still read 4 so i used the one that was currently at the mesocom. When looking at the par for the light levels it never exceeded 500 and sumthing which i thought strange seeing that the data I have seen previously by others in the lab exceeds 1000. I was to do fv/fm but the rain did not stop and was very heavy. the acclimation tank in outside but covered with the tank covers, never the less this made it impossible to comduct fv/fm. 

06/28/2024
Today I did a tris calibration as well as prepare some script for future use, plan what is to be done tomorrow and run/work on PIcurve script. Using data from the github worked when I ran it weeks ago however now i am running into some issues. Checked with Jill and shes not sure why it won't run so I'll take another look tomorrow

06/29/2024
Today i began to do pam however it deemed very taxing on both Jill and I and as a result discussed a power analysis with mock data to determine a suitable and doable sample size per treatment, I also need to work out a suitable time to begin to complete measurments before the sun comes up. We did however get measurements for most of Dlab colony 1.

07/01/2024
A Tris calibration was done along with daily measurments. water heaters was placed in tank 4 and 6 to determine if it was work when splitting the treatments for the final phase of the experiment. I have been tweating with the CO2 header tank for a few days now to get the right pH. I also used the calibrated pH probe to tell me the pH and a sample of the water with the orion to confirm that the pH is that. I have also checked that the water exiting the CO2 Header tank into the tanks shows the same pH. The treatment tanks are set up however i am waiting for the hose splitter and the crates.

07/02/2024
I began pam at 4am with Maddie Brett's intern however an hour the rain rain began and continued until the sun rose which prevented the continuation of measurments because the acclimation tank has not shelter.Later that morning I conducted daily measurments and place temp probe 4 into the basin to determine if the overflow from the heated tank inside would change the water temperture in the basin causing the chillers to decrease it's temp to cool them down. It did not change the chiller temperature.
I also set up the acid wash station in Yvonne's fumehood and placed the bottles meant for TA inside to soak for 24hrs at 15:00hrs.

07/03/2024
Cleaned the basins and tanks, did the daily measurments, recieved the new batteries for the PAM so I charged them, took the bottles out of the acid wash and placed into the milliq waterbath then checked the pH of the acidwash bath to ensure it was <1 then placed another set of bottles in the acid wash bath.
Colleted TA sample at 17:14hrs. While doing daily measurments I noticed that one of the Dlab colonies not being used spawned in the tanks. Oneof the turn tables or P&R was not work due to one of the wires being torn apart from the start button that was connected to the battery so I took it to the workshop to get it looked and and had it temporarily fixed by joining the wires together. I then placed the charged batteries in the stirtable to test them out for about 2hrs.

07/04/2024
Did daily measurements, I wanted to test how long the batteries could go for in the turntables to know what to expect when i had to use them so without charging them i turned the turntables on for a few hours and recorded how long together with yesterday they lasted. I also did a tris calibration. Basin 2 is no longer working, this was my CO2 basin so I have to remove the apex system from that tank and place it on the tank behind it which was orginally my control basin (4) and move that apex set up to the ajacent tank, then connect the CO2 header tank to it so now basin basin 5 is my CO2, basin 4 will now be my control and basin 1 will remain heat. continued the acid wash protocol and a tris calibration. I attempted PAM this morning but the battery kept cutting out although I charged it so I replaced the battery.

07/05/2024
Did PAM early this morning around 12am. Daily measurments.

07/07/2024
Did daily measurments, tris calibration and took a TA sample today. I also recieved the hose splitters, I completed the tank set up. 

07/08/2024
Today we started off to do daily measurements then did P&R. after each run we then cleaned the plugs and took photos of the corals for color score and possiblely grey scale.

07/09/2024
Same thing as yesterday however after P&R along with the photos we calibrated the apex pH probes, sampled the corals then placed 4 per genotype in each treatment tank by 23:00hrs where i began the ramp up. I also recieved the crate today so we had to cut it and make holding crates from all tanks.

07/10/2024
Took daily measurments, did a tris calibration.

07/11/2024
Did Pam. Began to have issues with the pH readings, the apex was reading differently from the orion so I collected water a sample from the header tank feeding tube and the pH reading from the orion read the same as the apex, this means that the low pH water in the headertank at the intended pH is not enough to continue to acidify the water. this is weird because I had no issue before when i tested the system. This means then that i need to decrease the pH in the header tank to get the intended pH.
Around 14:25 tanks 2 and 3 stopped working meaning the chillers and the pump. I had to move the treatments tanks temporary to the adjacent basin due to the fast increase in temperature. Someone came to fix it 2 hours later and advised to let it run a few hours first before putting the corals back into that basin so I placed them back into their treatment basin by 11pm.

07/12/2024
Daily measurements, I also calibrated all the pH probes then as well. I decreased the pH range on the apex probe from the CO2 header tank, the probe is reading to basic than the actual value in the treatment tanks

07/13/2024
Daily measuremnts, checked the pH with the YSI of the CO2 header tank andpH was different than readings still. took a look inside the header tank and the water was low so I had to increase flow into the CO2 header tank then i calibrated all the pH probes.

07/15/2024
Daily measurments, collected TA samples and did a tris calibration, I had to change the chillers to a cooler temperature because the water is getting hotter than intended usually 28 degrees. I am also draining some of the water manually from tank 2 and 3 to add water from the CO2 header tank because water is getting to basic. I have also still been decreased the flow from the header tanks because at night the water in gets to cold and during the day to hot which does not give the chiller time to act as an approriate water bath.

07/16/2024
daily measuremnts then did P&R then photos for color score and/or grey scale were taken.

07/17/2024
Same as yesterday, corals that were not measured for P&R just measured for their color score and/or greyscale. Found corals that belonged in tank 3 in tank2, luckily its the same treatment however, corals found in tank 2 where from tank 5 which is control so I texted Hollie and then moved them back to their orginal tanks.

07/18/2024
Daily measurments, found about 2-3 corals that needed to be moved back to their tanks (missed them yesterday). Dis a tris calibration.

07/19/2024
Pam did not charge for the morning so today I did daily measurments, talked to Yvonne about using her PAM and just did pam that night.

07/20/2024
Daily measurments and adjusted temps. PS every day I've had to adjust chiller temperatures multiple times a day and drain some of the water from the pH treatmnets to let a inflow of acidic water enter the tank.

07/21/2024
Daily measurments

07/22/2024
Daily measurements and P&R along with color score/grey scale photos

07/23/2024
Did Pam this morning but died halfway through. Did daily temperatures and P&R along with color score and greyscale photos. All corals not used in P&R, photos were still taken for color score and grey scale. did the last round of P&R and sampled the corals on my own then the CO2 and heat treatments stopped. 

07/24/2024
Did dialy measuremnts, and a tris calibration. took hobo data for all tanks from the priming phase.

07/25/2024
Daily measurments

07/26/2024
PAM, daily measurements and TA sampling
